# Notes for Vue.js
---
- The App.vue file is the single-file component. It houses all the JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. (This is the main selling point of Vue)

- The `<script>` tag is used to write functions. You can then use it in the `<template>` tag. You can make a JavaScript file containing the 
App.vue and a CSS file if you want to seperate for better readability.
